# Build Instructions for GST Billing App

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git (optional, for cloning)
- Google Chrome (for WhatsApp sharing)
- Supported thermal printer drivers (for printing)

## 1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <project-folder>
```

## 2. Set Up Virtual Environment
```
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

## 3. Install Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 4. Run the Application (for development)
```
python main.py
```

## 5. Build Standalone Executable (Windows)
- Make sure you are in the project root and the virtual environment is activated.
- Install PyInstaller if not already installed:
  ```
  pip install pyinstaller
  ```
- Build the executable:
  ```
  pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --add-data "data_base;data_base" --add-data "bills;bills" main.py
  ```
  - The `--add-data` options ensure the database and bill images are included.
  - The output executable will be in the `dist/` folder.

## 6. Notes
- On first run, the app will create the database and required folders if they do not exist.
- For WhatsApp sharing, ensure Chrome is installed and you are logged in to WhatsApp Web.
- For printing, connect and configure your thermal printer in Admin Settings.

## 7. Troubleshooting
- If you see missing module errors, ensure all dependencies are installed in your virtual environment.
- If WhatsApp automation fails, try increasing the wait time in the code or focus the browser window manually.
- For further help, see the README.md or contact the maintainer.
